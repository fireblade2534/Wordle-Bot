# Wordle-Bot
This is a simple Wordle solver bot I made.

### How to use
1. Run Main.py
2. Open your wordle site (Tested on https://bosorioo.github.io/wordle-unlimited/) 
3. Type in the best guess into your worldle game
4. Input the code into the enter code field
5. Go to step 3

### Codes
The codes are 5 digits. Each digit corosponds to one letter of the best guess. If the letter at that position is grey type in a 0. If the letter at that position is yellow type in a 0. If the letter at that position is green type in a 0.
